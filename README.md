# pelican-semantic-ui-dark
A dark pelican theme based on semantic ui

Somewhat based on another semantic theme: https://github.com/ellisonleao/pelican-semantic-ui but with Semantic UI loaded via CDN and the usage of some newer
Semantic-UI concepts like lists, inverted and colored menu's and some extra config options. It tries to use Semantic-UI base theme and css as much as possible so it relies
a lot on "inverted" semantic UI components instead of writing/using a custom semantic-ui dark theme.
